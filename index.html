<h1>Here i will tell you about me</h1>
<p> My full name is Diksha Sharma. I have a very beautiful family in India including my mother, father, brother, and my dog.
I completed high school in 2020 with physics, chemistry, and mathematics from India and after that, I moved to Canada for further studies alone. Am doing a diploma in computer engineering technician at Northern College, Toronto.
